# kmeans
The purpose of this project is to implement a version of kmeans as a python module written in Rust.
The goal is a better performing kmeans module for python, than is currently available through packages like sklearn.

# Future prospects
If this kmeans implementations sparks sufficient interest in the community, implementations other ML algorithms may be considered in the future.
